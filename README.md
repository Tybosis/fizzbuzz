This is a simple fizzbuzz method that accepts an argument of one integer and
returns 'FizzBuzz' if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, 'Fizz' if it is
divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if it is divisible by 5, and the number itself if
it is not divisible by either 3 or 5.

With my approach I was trying to make the code easy to follow what is happening,
and also only have one way out.  I think my methodology is a little more
elegant than a long if..else chain, but also not overly criptic.
